🎣 Fisherman Game
This is a personal educational project where I've recreated a simplified version of a classic fishing game. In this game, the player uses the spacebar to control a hook that catches fish. The goal is to reach a target score within one minute to advance to the next level.

🚀 Features
🎮 Control the hook using the spacebar.
🐟 Catch fish and avoid obstacles.
⏱️ Time-limited levels with score tracking.
🎯 Simple and engaging gameplay.
🎓 Purpose
This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development, specifically focusing on improving my skills in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It serves as a practical example of applying MVC architecture, game mechanics, and DOM manipulation.

🕹️ How to Play
Press the spacebar to release the hook.
Catch fish to earn points.
Reach the target score within one minute to advance to the next level.
