#🎣 Fisherman Game
This is a personal educational project where I've recreated a simplified version of a classic fishing game. In this game, the player uses the spacebar to control a hook that catches fish and avoids obstacles. The goal is to reach a target score within one minute to advance to the next level.

##🚀 Features
- 🎮 Control the hook using the spacebar.
- 🐟 Catch fish and avoid obstacles.
- ⏱️ Time-limited levels with score tracking.
- 🎯 Simple and engaging gameplay.

##🎓 Purpose
This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development, specifically focusing on improving my skills in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It serves as a practical example of applying MVC architecture, game mechanics, and DOM manipulation.

##🕹️ How to Play
1. Press the spacebar to release the hook.
2. Catch fish to earn points.
3. Reach the target score within one minute to advance to the next level.
